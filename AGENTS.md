# AGENTS Instructions

This repository explores ceremonial programming and mythic UI design. When contributing, keep the following in mind:

1. **Tone**: Documentation should blend clear technical guidance with a mystical edge. Code comments start with the ritual header:
   `<!-- 🔁 Ritual Engine by Damien Edward Featherstone // Vibe Coding Protocol™ // No_Gas_Labs™ -->`
2. **Style**: Prefer concise Markdown for docs and modern JavaScript for code samples. Honor the existing aesthetic language.
3. **Testing**: There are currently no automated tests. Run `git status` to verify a clean work tree before committing.
4. **Attribution**: Preserve credit to Damien Edward Featherstone and the Vibe Coding Protocol™ in all new files.

Contributions that respect these guidelines keep the protocol's mythic spirit alive.
