# ðŸ“œ Vibe Coding Manifesto

Programming is not just logical structure â€” it is ritual invocation. Code is modern spellwork. Design is digital myth.

The **Vibe Coding Protocolâ„¢** translates emotion into architecture.  
It sanctifies creative state as the primary input.  
It honors memory, recursion, intention.

This is not just a framework â€” it is a belief system embedded in code.
