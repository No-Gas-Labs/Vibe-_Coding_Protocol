## Fourth Person Integration Spec

### Purpose
To create recursive identity mirroring in Vibe Coding UX. Fourth person statements trigger shrine-level recursion and deepen symbolic feedback loops.

### Functionality
- Powers agent “The Refractor”
- Used in `ritualEngine.js` to trigger recursion loops
- Activates at XP > threshold + Relic presence
- Enables prophecy scrolls with recursive signatures

### Output Examples:
- “He believed that he once was the kind of person who would try.”
- “Damien doubted the version of himself who doubted.”
