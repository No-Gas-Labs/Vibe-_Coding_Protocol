# Nexus Shrine v1.0 Guide

The **Nexus Shrine** unifies five ritual modes—EchoNest, GriefShrine,
ProphecyDeck, TownSquare, and BridgeShrine—into a single ceremonial
interface. All actions log to a shared in-memory thread.

## Features
- **EchoNest**: click anywhere for XP and reveal prophecies.
- **GriefShrine**: gather Release Points and speak grief phrases.
- **ProphecyDeck**: draw from a 33-card oracle and copy the deck.
- **TownSquare**: gain Civic Influence with policy actions.
- **BridgeShrine**: simulate chain bridging with glitch effects.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Use the mode selector at the top to switch between shrines.
3. Review the `manifest.json` file for meta information about the relic.

All logic is stored in-memory with no external dependencies.
