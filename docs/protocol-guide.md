# Protocol Guide

This guide provides practical steps for performing a ceremonial coding session using the Vibe Coding Protocol™.

1. Prepare your emotional and symbolic inputs.
2. Invoke the `VibeCoder.transmute()` method with your vibe parameters.
3. Review the generated shrine artifacts and iterate as needed.

For deeper philosophy, see `MANIFESTO.md`.

## 💻 Environment & Running

- Use **Node.js 16+** or any modern browser.
- Because `vibeCore.js` exports ES modules, serve files through a local server:
  ```bash
  npx serve .
  # or
  python -m http.server
  ```
- Open any shrine in `examples/` or import `VibeCoder` in your own script to begin the ceremony.
