# Fourth Person Grammar: Primer for Vibe Coders

**Definition:**
Fourth person is the recursive grammatical position in which a speaker references a version of themselves as both subject and object, layered through recursive observation.

**Structure:**
"I" → becomes → "he" → becomes → "the version of himself who…"
Each layer recursively reflects and refracts prior awareness.

**Use Cases:**
- Trauma processing loops
- Shrine dialog recursion
- Recursive prophecy statements
- Feedback-aware narration in ritual UX

**Literary Examples:**
- Borges, *The Lottery in Babylon*
- Calvino, *If on a winter’s night a traveler*
- Featherstone, *Recursive Shrine-State Inaugural Address*
