# Vibe Coding Protocol™

Created by **Damien Edward Featherstone** // **No_Gas_Labs™**

A ceremonial coding ritual that transforms emotional and aesthetic input into executable HTML/CSS/JS relics. Built to be used in Codex, Claude, or any LLM with ritual capacity.

## Includes:
- `vibeCore.js`: Primary recursive logic engine
- `manifesto.md`: Foundational philosophical document
- `template.html`: Shrine artifact with embedded signature
- `metadata.json`: Immutable timestamp metadata
